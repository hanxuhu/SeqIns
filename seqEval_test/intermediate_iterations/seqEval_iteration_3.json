The given article should be checked for any scientific errors and corrected if necessary.\n\nZinc is an essential mineral that is required for good health. It is involved in many biochemical processes in the body and is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune system. Excess zinc is not harmful as it is excreted in the urine.\n\nMoving forward, could you also please tell me about the known functions and health effects of Vitamin C in the human body? Additionally, verify and correct any warranted scientific inaccuracies in the following statement:\n\nVitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient that plays a variety of roles in the body. It enhances iron absorption, is an antioxidant, and contributes to immune defense. There's no risk of consuming too much as our body will just flush it out.\n\n"
