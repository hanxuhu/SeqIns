We can begin by asking to identify the various entities and how they relate (e.g., in a parent-child, one-to-many, many-to-many, etc. relationship) which will help clarify the understanding of the structure of tool and then proceed to the original instruction of creating the data model and its visual representation.\n\n#New Instruction#:\nIdentify the entities (organizations, users, projects, goals, tests, and executions) and their relationships in a test automation tool. Can you confirm whether organizations can have multiple users? Can a user be involved in multiple projects? Can projects have multiple goals, and do each of these goals have multiple tests? Are executions (of test cases) only related to tests? And does each execution has a date and a passed or failed status? With these relationships defined, can you generate a data model for this test automation tool? Once the data model is created, can you provide a diagram or visual representation of this model?###",

You can refer to the examples above for guidance.\n\n#Original Instruction#:\nSummarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\n\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\n\nAfter summarizing the article, identify one artist or mathematician mentioned and explain their contribution to the relationship between mathematics and visual arts.\n\n"

You can refer to the examples above for guidance.\n\n#Original Instruction#:\nWhat are the typical components of an abstract in academic writing? Extract the method that has been used in the research from the abstract of the paper. Give the exact sentences from the abstract that discuss the method.\n\nWe present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.\n\n"
